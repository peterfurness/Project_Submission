Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data
Codebook for dataset:  "combined_data_tidy.txt"
Created:  22/11/2014

==================================================================
This dataset is based on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 prepared by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory, Genoa, Italy www.smartlab.ws further details of which may be found in the files "README.txt" and "features_info.txt"  supplied with the Coursera project materials
==================================================================

The datasets are based on experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each subject performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, and captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocities at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments were video-recorded in order to label the data manually. 

The Coursera supplied data included training and test datasets in which each obervation represents a summary of sensor signal data (a feature vector of variables) for a subject undertaking a particular activity.  Files enabling these observations to be linked with a subject ID and activity Code were also provided.  There are multiple records for each subject/activity combination representing activity repetitions for each of 30 subjects.

In creating the "combined_data_tidy.txt" dataset we first selected only those feature variables which related to means or standard deviations (a total of 86 variables out of a total of 561 variables). Secondly we computed the means of each of these 86 variables for each subject/activity combination.  See the "README.md" and "run_analysis.R" files for further details of the processing carried out.

The variables in "combined_data_tidy.txt" are listed below alongside the column number.  Columns 1 and 2 give subject and activity (WALKING etc) respectively.  Columns 3 to 88 give the MEANS of the 86 sensory feature variables where the mean has been taken over the particular subject/activity combination.  The names of variables are derived from those given in the "features.txt" file supplied with the Coursera project materials and further information can be found in the "README.txt" and "features_info.txt" which were also supplied with the Coursera project materials.
